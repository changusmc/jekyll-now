I'm currently an Android Engineer and Tech Lead of Mobile Apps Foundation at Dropbox. I have a passion for improving the developer experience, builds, and tooling. I also really enjoy helping others grow. 

My path to tech was long and windy, as I joined the U.S. Marines after high school. The Marines taught me a few skills that I was missing: discipline and work ethic. After 4 years of being a Network Admin in the Marines, I decided to jump back into my civilian life and go to college. I had no clue what I was signing myself up for when I selected Computer Science as my major. I got destroyed in my first CS course, but I'm glad I stuck with it.

I started my journey in mobile development in college when I took a course that paired groups of four to create an app on Android or iOS. For the first assignment, I wrote a basic Android weather app and wanted to be paired with an Android team. However, since I had a Macbook, my professor forced me to work on iOS. Several years later when I was in my second job after spending some time as a desktop and server engineer, I was presented with an opportunity to join the Android team at Salesforce. The rest is history, and I've enjoyed the platform and the amazing community around it.
