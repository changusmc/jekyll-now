title: 90 Day Retrospective After Joining Pinterest
---

I started at Pinterest in June after deliberation on which of the [3 offers to take](https://changd.dev/Landing-Three-Staff-Engineer-Offers/). I've been extremely happy and wanted to share a quick retrospective on my time since joining.

## Onboarding
Pinterest has a similar onboarding process as other large tech companies that I've worked in. I had a 2-week firehose onboarding session, and most of the sessions were very relevant to my job. I was given an onboarding plan that included 30, 60, 90 day milestones and assigned a mentor to help ensure that I wasn't lost in the weeds. My first week was unlike any past experience that I've had, as I got the opportunity to attend [Knitcon](https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/knit-con-2022-taking-inspiration-to-realization-for-our-employees), our internal conference where we bring Pinterest to life. This was the first time in over 2 years that I've met colleagues in real life. I learned about [talking dogs from Christina Lee](https://twitter.com/i/status/1552382107384655873) and attended lots of other great sessions. I was able to meet my manager and my skip manager. 

For my onboarding tasks, they were all relatively straightforward for me to complete. Pinterest uses technology that I'm familiar with: Gradle, Buildkite, and Phabricator (hopefully not for much longer). The custom systems for Analytics and Deployment that we use weren't all too bad to learn. I was able to surpass my 90 day milestone at 30 days, as I was able to fully roll out Gradle Configuration Cache amongst other things I was responsible for. 

## What went well
### Focus
My team has a more narrow ownership in the Developer Productivity space than my previous team at Dropbox. This leads way more focus and less distractions around priority.

### My management chain makes my life easier
This is the first time in my career that I'm reporting to a former Android engineer, and that makes communication so much easier. I was able to quickly build trust with my manager, so I get to spend a lot of my time doing uninterrupted work and coming up for air every so often. 

### Traveling to DroidconNYC
I wanted to travel to New York for Droidcon, and I was not a speaker. I didn't need to jump through any hoops on explaining the value of it, it was just approved. I got to meet some amazing people and learned a lot of new things.

### Build vs Buy
While we have some pretty neat internal tools for experimentation and analytics, I'm happy that we also are very open to paying for solutions. 

### People
My team is incredibly talented and great to work with. I haven't met a jerk at Pinterest yet, I hope it stays that way.

## What didn't go well
### Hiring slowdown
Pinterest was hiring pretty aggressively when I joined, but shortly after we instituted a slowdown. The silver lining is that we didn't overhire and we're not laying off or rescinding offers.

### Digitally Social
People don't seem to be as talkative on Slack compared to what I'm used to. I know Pinployees can be very chatty in person, maybe everyone is too busy working.

### Locality Based Pay
I accepted the job offer knowing that the Los Angeles market gets a 10% cut, but I hope that we will remove that one day.
